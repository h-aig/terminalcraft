# Mastercode

This is a terminal-based password manager and diary application built using the `urwid` library for the user interface and `cryptography.fernet` for encryption. The application allows you to manage passwords, store encrypted diary entries, and configure settings.

## Features

- **Password Management**: Add, view, edit, and delete passwords. Notes aswell!
- **Diary**: Add, view, and delete encrypted diary entries that noone but you can access.
- **Settings**: Configure password generation length and allow/disallow duplicate diary entries.
- **Encryption**: All passwords and diary entries and password notes are encrypted using `cryptography.fernet`.
- **Browser password support**: Supports importing and exporting passwords in csv web browser format. Mastercode thrives in this use case as it can be used for encrypting your passwords and accessing them and re-exporting them again without relying on browser password managers!
- **File navigation**: for importing and exporting files, easy to use.
- **Passy**: A digital cow that shows various funny faces and criticises/compliments your passwords.
- **Mouse compatibility**: Wanna rebell? Go for it, click the menus and buttons with your mouse.
