## Struggles

- Please, next time there is an event/project to do, please ... consider if you really want to do it in terminal (for me its pure agony).
- Getting data from every OS (Windows, MacOS and Linux).
- Fighting with widths, paddings and color palletes.
- First time doing "big" project in python.
