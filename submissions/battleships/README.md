# TerminalCraft - Battleships

Hello! This is a terminal-based version of the game battleships.

## Instructions

### Setup

Make sure you have Python installed.

Download the main.py file from this repository.

### Running the program

Navigate to the correct directory in the terminal.

Run the command 'py main.py'.

### How to play

The concept is just like the classic battleships game, where you and a bot take turns shooting at the opponent's ships. 

The first choice you are given is whether you want to place your ships manually or automatically. You have 5 ships to place. If you choose to place them automatically, your ships will be placed randomly on the board. If you choose to place them manually, 
- you first need to choose a coordinate (with the format letter(A-J)number(1-10)) for the tip of your ship to go.
- Then, you choose in which direction (up, down, left or right) the body of the ship should be placed.
Once your ships have been placed, the game can begin.

You take turns shooting at each others boards with the same coordinate format (letter(A-J)number(1-10)), and whoever has hit all the opponent's ships first wins!

### Voilà! That should allow you to play battleships from your terminal. Enjoy!
