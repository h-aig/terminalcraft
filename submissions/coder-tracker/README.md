## 📚 Usage

Sessions are the main focus of this tool, but before you create a session, you need to create some goals. Whether that'd be finishing a feature or squashing a bug, you can create a goal for it.

After creating a goal, you can start a session and pick the goals you want to finish. You will also need to set a timer for your session.

When you're done with your session, you can finish it and see your statistics via the History page, or (coming soon) the summary page.
