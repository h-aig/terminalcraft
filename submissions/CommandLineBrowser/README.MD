## Running it

Just rain the main.py file ðŸ’€ (but make sure you have all of the dependencies first). Or if you have a Mac just run the executable to run the program. If you are feeling extra cool (or just don't have a Mac) you can compile itself using the compile.py script, so long as you have the Pyinstaller library installed.
